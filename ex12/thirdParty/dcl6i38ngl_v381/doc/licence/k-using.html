<H1>Kusari User Guide (Unix) Release 2.2</H1>
<H2><A NAME="AUTOTOC_1"></A>1 
Introduction</H2>
<P>
This document describes the Kusari Licence Management System for the user of
products which it controls.
<H2><A NAME="AUTOTOC_2"></A>2 
Where Kusari looks for licence information</H2>
<P>
Kusari looks for licence information based on the <TT>NAG_KUSARI_FILE</TT>
environment variable.
This variable should contain a file name (path), a licence server
specification, or a comma-separated list of file names and licence servers.
<P>
A file name can contain any printing character except comma (<TT>,</TT>),
semi-colon (<TT>;</TT>), at-sign (<TT>@</TT>), or colon (<TT>:</TT>).
For example,
<TT>/somedirectory/somefilename.something</TT>.
<P>
A licence server specification consists of a server name (or IP number)
followed by a colon, and optionally by a port number.  For example,
<TT>some-machine.some-company.com:</TT>.
<P>
When a product requests a licence, Kusari will visit each file, or ask each
server, in turn, until it finds one with a potential licence.
It will then attempt to check out a licence from that source; if this fails
the failure will be reported and no further sources will be checked.
<P>
If the environment variable <TT>NAG_KUSARI_FILE</TT> is not set, Kusari will look
for the files <TT>nag.key</TT>, <TT>nag.licence</TT> and <TT>nagware.licence</TT>
(in that order) firstly in the current working directory and secondly in the
user's home directory.
Depending on the software product it might also look for these files in the
product's installation directory.
<P>
The environment variable may be set by the <TT>setenv</TT> command in the
C-shell, e.g.
<PRE>
               setenv NAG_KUSARI_FILE mylicence.data
</PRE>
or by the <TT>export</TT> command in the Bourne shell, e.g.
<PRE>
               export NAG_KUSARI_FILE=mylicence.data
</PRE>
<H2><A NAME="AUTOTOC_3"></A>3 
Single machine licences</H2>
<P>
Single machine licences are provided in licence files, accessed directly by
the software as determined by the <TT>NAG_KUSARI_FILE</TT> environment variable
(see above).
<P>
A licence file may contain blank lines, comment lines (beginning with a
<TT>'#'</TT> or <TT>'!'</TT> character, and licence key lines.
Here is a sample licence file:
<PRE>
! Licence file for Fred Nurke's Machine.

! A full licence for the NAGWare f95 compiler, Release 4.1
NPBSD41NA FULL "qfrdwhyMoQFkfpm5e6ESprJmtE"

! A trial licence for the NAGWare f95 compiler, Release 5.0
NPLUX50NA TRIAL 2004/10/05 "EMnxidA3oeojOFlYvi5ibxPjB7"

! A licence for the NAG C Library on this machine, Mark 7:
CLLUX70NA NODE 2005/01/01 "xhhhTkzEiUPgdIpwIbCHgrBjjv"

! That's all folks.
</PRE>
<P>
Depending on the specific hardware features of a machine, a licence key line
may contain multiple key specifications, e.g.
<PRE>
NPBSD42NA FULL "xhhhTkzEiUPgdIpwIbCHgrBjjv" "EMnxidA3oeojOFlYvi5ibxPjB7"
</PRE>
The purpose of the additional key(s) is to ensure that the licence
software functions correctly even for machines with unusual hardware, and
has no significance for the user.
On some machines the key specifications take up more than one line, in
which case each line except the last will end with an ampersand (&amp;),
and each line but the first will start with an ampersand; for example,
<PRE>
NPLUX50NA FULL "GiioUjNInkfkuBl8HgbLgunh5y" "iBdlgdsxn9vl1Qggfc4NaPDkpK" &amp;
&amp; "BVe3We9slESmL=glKl8fiXReQY"
</PRE>
<A NAME="AUTOTOC_3_1"></A><H3>3.1 
Trial (Demo) Licences</H3>
A trial licence provides limited access to the specified software for an
evaluation period.
It is indicated by the <TT>"TRIAL"</TT> keyword, and contains an expiry date
and a licence key.
<P>
When the evaluation is finished, it is recommended that the trial licence
key lines be deleted from the licence file.
<A NAME="AUTOTOC_3_2"></A><H3>3.2 
Node Licences</H3>
A node licence provides full access to the specified software, on a single
machine, for the duration of the licence period.
The identification of the machine on which the software is to be run is
required for the generation of a licence key; this is produced by the
<TT>khostid</TT> program.
<P>
A node licence is indicated by the <TT>"NODE"</TT> or <TT>"NODEG"</TT> keyword, and
contains an expiry date and a licence key.
<P>
When a licence is renewed, the old licence key line must be deleted and the
new licence key line inserted.
<A NAME="AUTOTOC_3_3"></A><H3>3.3 
Perpetual Licences</H3>
A perpetual licence provides full access to the software, on a single machine,
for an indefinite period.
This requires the machine identification produced by <TT>khostid</TT>.
(Also, perpetual licences are only available for some software products.)
<P>
A perpetual licence is indicated by the <TT>"FULL"</TT> keyword, and contains a
licence key but no expiry date.
<A NAME="AUTOTOC_3_4"></A><H3>3.4 
Server Redirections</H3>
A server redirection line in a licence file instructs Kusari to ask a licence
server; it consists of an optional product code, followed by the <TT>SERVER</TT>
keyword and finally a licence server specification.
Example server redirection lines are:
<PRE>
NPBSD51NA SERVER some-machine.some-company.com:
SERVER another-machine.some-company.com:
</PRE>
The first line redirects Kusari to the named server for the product
<TT>NPBSD51NA</TT> only.
The second line redirects Kusari to the named server for all products.
<H2><A NAME="AUTOTOC_4"></A>4 
Licence Servers</H2>
<P>
Site licences are provided by licence servers; the licences provided by a
particular server are contained in its control file.
<P>
All site licences provide access to the software to anyone at a site who
can communicate with the licence server (over the local network).
<P>
Thus successful use of a site licence from a user program requires the
following:
<OL>
<LI>
The licence server must be running on the server machine.
<LI>
The licence key line for the site licence must appear in the control file for
that licence server.
<LI>
The user program must have the <TT>NAG_KUSARI_FILE</TT> environment variable set
to refer to the licence server.
For example, if the licence server is running on machine <TT>ls.fred.co.uk</TT>,
with the default port number,
the <TT>NAG_KUSARI_FILE</TT> environment variable should contain
<TT>ls.fred.co.uk:</TT>.
(Alternatively, <TT>NAG_KUSARI_FILE</TT> could point to a licence file that
contained a redirection line for the server <TT>ls.fred.co.uk:</TT>.)
</OL>
<P>
The installation process for a licence server is described in the Kusari
Installation Guide.
<A NAME="AUTOTOC_4_1"></A><H3>4.1 
Floating Licences</H3>
A floating licence authorises the licence server to permit up to a specified
number of concurrent users of the software.
<P>
One licence is required for each combination of user id and machine for
which concurrent use is required; for example, two different users on the same
machine will require two licences, as will the same user on two different
machines.  However, only one licence is required for multiple uses by the same
user on a single machine.
<P>
If the licence server cannot grant a licence request for a product because all
of its floating licences have already been checked out, the product will either
queue for a licence to become available or terminate with an error message.
The default action is to queue for a licence, unless a product-specific option
has been used (e.g. for the f95 compiler the <TT>-noqueue</TT> option) or the
<TT>NAG_FLOATING_NOQUEUE</TT> environment variable is set.
<P>
When a program has to wait for a floating licence, it may (depending on the
software product) display an informative message indicating that it is queued.
This message also indicates the position in the queue.
When a licence is finally received, an informative message may be produced;
the program will then continue its normal execution.
<H2><A NAME="AUTOTOC_5"></A>5 
Troubleshooting</H2>
<P>
If the application reports ``<TT>Error: Licence file not found</TT>'', check
<OL>
<LI>
The environment variable <TT>NAG_KUSARI_FILE</TT> is set correctly.
<LI>
The environment variable contains the full pathname of the licence file.
<LI>
The file is readable.
</OL>
