        <!-- 4. Installation on Linux-->

<h3><a name="installation_lin">4. Installation on Linux</a></h3>

        <!-- 4.1. Normal Installation-->

<h4><a name="dcoinst">4.1. Normal Installation</a></h4>
<p>
Assuming you have downloaded the dco/c++ installer from our website, extract the installation materials using the following command:
</p>
<pre>
  tar xvzf dcl6i38ngl_v381.tgz
</pre>
<p>
This will extract the files in.html, install.sh, dcl6i38ngl_v381.tar.gz and nag_tsandcs.txt.
</p>
<p>
You can then install the materials from the download directory by executing the shell script install.sh in a command window as:
</p>
<pre>
  ./install.sh
</pre>

<p>
By default, the dco/c++ materials are installed in
<pre>
  ${HOME}/NAG/dcl6i38ngl_v381

</pre>
or the equivalent for your locale.

        <!-- 4.2. Silent Installation -->

<h4><a name="silent">4.2. Silent Installation</a></h4>

It is also possible to run <tt>install.sh</tt>
in unattended or silent modes. The installer takes command
line switches for this purpose:
<ul>
  <li><tt>-silent</tt>
    <br>
    means perform a silent installation. In this case, the <tt>-accept</tt> and
     <tt>-installdir</tt> switches must also be used
  <li><tt>-accept</tt>
    <br>
    means that you accept the NAG licence agreement
  <li><tt>-installdir=DIR</tt>
    <br>
    means that the library will be installed under directory <tt>DIR</tt>
</ul>

        <!-- 4.3. Licence Management -->
<!-- Licence Management section appears only if we have Linux or Windows, never both so it will be 4.3 in any case. -->
<h4><a name="licence">4.3. Licence Management</a></h4>

The use of this product is controlled by the Kusari licence
management system. This release of dco/c++ uses version
2.2-88 of Kusari.

<p>
In order to enable the software, NAG will issue you with a licence key.
The licence key is contained in a text file consisting of details of
the software that will be enabled.
For evaluation purposes a trial licence may be used.

Before obtaining a full licence you need to know the Kusari hostid of
the system on which you intend to use this product. How to do this
is described below.

<!-- License comments for Linux -->
<div class="paramtext">
To request a licence key, run the program <span class="mono"> khostid </span>
located in the
<span class="mono">bin</span>
subdirectory of the software distribution. This utility must be run
from a command prompt. Return the information that it displays,
together with the product code (in this case DCL6I38NGL),
by email to NAG.
Alternatively, direct the output from this utility to a file and
send both the file and the product code to NAG.
</div>

<div class="paramtext">
A short term (demonstration or trial) licence key contains one or more
lines like the following:
</div>

<pre class="verbatim">&lt;PRODUCT_CODE&gt; TRIAL &lt;EXPIRY_DATE&gt; "EMnxidA3oeoj0F1Yvi5ibxPjB7"
</pre>

<div class="paramtext">
Specifically, it has a line containing the word <span class="mono">TRIAL</span>.
Longer term licence keys must be locked to a specific
computer, i.e. they will enable the software on one computer only.
These licence keys typically include the word <span class="mono">NODE</span> or <span class="mono">FULL</span>
instead of the word <span class="mono">TRIAL</span> above and may contain extra fields.
</div>

<div class="paramtext">
Once you have obtained one of the above licence keys, the easiest way
to install it is to store the text in a file,
<pre class="verbatim">  $HOME/nag.key
</pre>
or
<pre class="verbatim">  /opt/NAG/nag.key
</pre>
or
<pre class="verbatim">  /usr/local/NAG/nag.key
</pre>
</div>

<div class="paramtext">
The licence software in this implementation automatically looks for these
particular
files and reads the first one found, so no further action is necessary.

Alternatively, store the licence in a file with a name and location of
your choice, say,
<pre class="verbatim">  dcl6i38ngl_v381/licence.lic
</pre>
</div>

<div class="paramtext">
The location of the licence file, if it is not one of the default
places listed above, must be
made known to the NAG application by setting the environment variable
<span class="mono">NAG_KUSARI_FILE</span> to the full pathname of the file before the
application is invoked.
</div>

<div class="paramtext">
For example, in the C shell, type:

<pre class="verbatim">  setenv NAG_KUSARI_FILE dcl6i38ngl_v381/licence.lic
</pre>

or in the Bourne shell, type:

<pre class="verbatim">  NAG_KUSARI_FILE=dcl6i38ngl_v381/licence.lic
  export NAG_KUSARI_FILE
</pre>
</div>

<div class="paramtext">
Further details about Kusari and how it may be configured to
suit your local circumstances
(e.g. how to install the licence key on a server)
are included in the Kusari Licence
Management documentation in the
<span class="mono">doc/licence/</span> subdirectory of the software distribution.

<a href="http://www.nag.com/content/kusari-frequently-asked-questions">Kusari FAQ</a>.

        <!-- 5. Example Programs -->

<h3><a name="examples">5. Example Programs</a></h3>

Access to the dco/c++ materials can be checked by running a few example
programs following the advice given below.
Detailed documentation on dco/c++ and examples is located in the User Guide
which can be found in the
<tt>dcl6i38ngl_v381/doc</tt>
directory.

<p>
More sophisticated examples (case studies) are located in folders
<ul>
  <li> case_studies/diffusion
  <li> case_studies/mc
  <li> case_studies/pde
  <li> case_studies/race
</ul>

<h4><a name="commandline">5.1. Running from the Command Line</a></h4>
        <!-- 5.1. The command line -->
<ul>

  <li> Open a 
  Linux
 command line to get access to the compilers and associated tools.  
  <li> Create a build directory anywhere on your machine.  
  <li> From your build directory type 
  <pre>
        cmake -S "&ltpath-to-source&gt"  -G "&lt A Makefiles Generator &gt"
  </pre>
    to generate the build system with the Makefiles generator of your choice. Then execute the corresponding build command to build 
    all the available examples and case studies.
    <p>
    For example, on Linux, you can use <code>make</code> and build using the following commands:
    <pre>
        cmake -S ${HOME}/NAG/dcl6i38ngl_v381 
        make 
    </pre>
  <li> To run the examples and case studies and compare against the provided result files run:
  <pre>
        ctest 
  </pre>
  
   Note that there may be small differences between observed and reference results, 
   depending on the environment.
  <li> You can build and run examples and case_studies individually by setting a target. 
       For example, to build and run only the <code>ga1s</code> example, use the following:
   <p>
   <pre>
        make examples.ga1s
        ./examples/examples.ga1s
   </pre>
</ul>
